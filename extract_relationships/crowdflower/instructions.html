  <p>This task was created by the Su Lab at The Scripps Research Institute. If you have any questions about the task, please do not hesitate to email your questions to tongli@scripps.edu</p>
  <p>Scientists all over the world are generating too much knowledge. Every day, more and more scientific articles are published in fields like biology and chemistry. In fact, the rate at which this information is produced greatly exceeds the ability of individual scientists to absorb all this information. You can think of the information being produced as a great river; individual scientists can only ever drink a small portion of this great river of knowledge.</p>
  <p>This is a problem, because scientists make decisions and perform experiments based on what they know. Since it is impossible for a single scientist to know everything, it is very possible that an experiment a scientist wants to perform, or a hypothesis that a scientist wants to test, has already been done, or is already known to be false.</p>
  <p>Since science is an expensive endeavour, we want to perform the most interesting experiments, those which generate new knowledge. These experiments are most likely to create breakthroughs like those which lead to modern medicines and technology. In order to do this, scientists require tools to help them stay informed and up-to-date.</p>
  <p>Scientists require tools which will be able to summarize large portions of scientific knowledge into structured pieces of information that the researcher can use to inform his or her decisions. Computer programs are an obvious choice for working through large amounts of information, because they work quickly. Many research groups are working on computer programs that would automatically read scientific articles and create pieces of knowledge from these articles. For example, a computer may read an article about how smoking can cause lung cancer, and extract the information: "[smoking] [causes] [lung cancer]". The extracted information is usually structured: as in, two concepts (smoking and lung cancer) are connected somehow ("causes").</p>
  <p>However, you can imagine that this is a difficult task to do, especially for computers, because human language and scientific papers are nuanced and complex. This is where crowdsourcing comes in. We believe that groups of non-specialist workers can determine the relationships between concepts with a similar accuracy as specialists, and can therefore clean up the information extracted by computers. We also believe that we can learn from crowdsourcing to improve the computer programs which automatically extract the structured information.</p>

  <h3>The Task</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Read a given abstract from a real scientific article. Pay special attention to the <span class="orig_sentence">highlighted sentence</span>. Two concepts from the article will be highlighted in different colors, <span class="subject_text">like</span> <span class="object_text">this</span>.</li>
    <li>Determine what kind of concept you think the two highlighted terms are. There are three choices: a gene, a disease, or a drug. The definitions for these categories are given below.</li>
    <li>After determining what the two concepts are, you will be asked to determine if the two concepts are somehow related. For example, you could be asked about whether beef and hamburgers are related. Concepts can be unrelated, positively related, speculatively related, or negatively related. Definitions and examples for each of the four relationship types are provided.</li>
    <li>Finally, if there was a broad relationship linking the two concepts (for example beef and hamburgers), then you will be asked to further classify and narrow down the relationship (such as "beef" is used to make "hamburgers").</li>
  </ol>
</div>


<h3>Making your judgement</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Use the text, your common sense, and the examples provided to make a judgement about the identity of and the relationship between the two highlighted concepts.</li>
  <li>Everything you need to make a judgement should be present in this task. However, feel free to use the internet to help make your decisions. If you find that you often do not have enough information to make an assessment, then please let us know so that we can improve the task.</li>

<h3>Definitions and examples</h3>

<h4>Entity definitions</h4>

<h4>Genes, Proteins, and Mutations <button type="button" id="toggle_gene_def">Toggle gene definitions</button></h4>
<div class="toggleable_info" id="gene_definitions">
  <ul>
    <li>Genes are parts of DNA molecules. Every living organism contains DNA.</li>
    <li>Genes contain information. An organism's genes determine the characteristics of that organism, such as how big it is, or how it looks.</li>
    <li>Genes are heritable. An organism's genes will be similar to those of its parents.</li>
    <li>Genes can change (be mutated). When a gene is mutated, it can cause a disease.</li>
    <li>Genes are used to make proteins. For example, an egg is made of many different proteins.</li>
    <li>A gene and the protein it makes are often referred to interchangeably.</li>
    <li>Although it is the mutation that ultimately causes a disease, scientists also care about the gene that a mutation comes from, because that allows patients to be tested to see if they have any mutations in that gene.</li>
  </ul>

  Examples of genes (<span class="key_concept">highlighted</span>) in text
  <ul>
    <li>Most of the glial growth inhibiting factors converge onto the <span class="key_concept">ROCK</span> signaling pathway in neurons.</li>
    <li>Here, we report on <span class="key_concept">MUC1</span> overexpression in HCC cell lines.</li>
    <li>Results: The chemokine landscape of ovarian cancer is heterogeneous with high expression of known lymphocyte-recruiting chemokines in tumors with intraepithelial T cells, whereas <span class="key_concept">CXCL10</span> is expressed quasi-universally, including in tumors lacking tumor infiltrating T cells.</li>
  </ul>
</div>


<h4>Chemical <button type="button" id="toggle_chemical_def">Toggle chemical definitions</button></h4>

    <li>Evaluation of <span class="key_concept">2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol acetate</span> as a substrate for acetylcholinesterase activity assay.</li>
    <li>Using human NT2 model neurons, we demonstrate that the pain reliever <span class="key_concept">Ibuprofen</span> decreases RhoA (Ras homolog gene family, member A GTPase) activation and promotes neurite growth.</li>
    <li>Inhibition of the downstream effector Rho kinase by the drug <span class="key_concept">Y-27632</span> results in a strong increase in neurite outgrowth.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<!-- four relationship type definitions -->

<h3>Definitions of the four kinds of relationships</h3>

<div id="relationship_definitions">
  <h4>Positive relationship</h4>
  <p><strong>Definition:</strong> the sentence clearly states that there is an association between the entities.</p>

  Examples of positively related concepts:
  <ul>
    <li>Consider the sentence: <span class="orig_sentence">Mutations in breast cancer susceptibility gene <span class="subject_text">BRCA1</span> (breast cancer early-onset 1) are associated with increased risk of developing <span class="object_text">breast and ovarian cancers</span>.</span></li>
    <li>In the sentence above, the sentence clearly states that mutations in the gene "BRCA1" cause higher risk of developing "breast and ovarian cancers". There is no dispute about the link between "BRCA1" and "breast and ovarian cancers", and therefore the two concepts are linked with a positive relationship.</li>
  </ul>


  <h4>Speculative relationship</h4>
  <p><strong>Definition:</strong> the sentence describes a putative (potential) relationship between the two concepts, but whether the relationship is certain is currently unknown.</p>

  Examples of speculatively related concepts:
  <ul>
    <li>Consider the sentence: <span class="orig_sentence"><span class="subject_text">NF-κB</span> is a critical link between inflammation and cancer, but whether <span class="object_text">long non-coding RNAs</span> (lncRNAs) regulate its activation remains unknown.</span></li>
    <li>In the sentence above, "long non-coding RNAs" are linked to "NF-κB" by a speculative relationship. The sentence clearly states that "whether lncRNAs regulate [NF-κB]'s activation remains unknown". Therefore we think that long non-coding RNAs can activate NF-κB, but whether this is actually known cannot be determined from the sentence.</li>
    <li>Consider the sentence: <span class="orig_sentence">The inhibitory effect of <span class="subject_text">paeonol</span> on ICAM-1 production might be mediated by inhibiting p38, <span class="object_text">ERK</span> and NF-kappaB signaling pathways, which are involved in TNF-alpha-induced ICAM-1 production.</span></li>
    <li>The sentence above is talking about how a drug (paeonol) could be reducing the production of a protein (ICAM-1). The sentence says that "paeonol" might be exerting its effects by acting upon either "p38", "ERK", or "NF-kappaB", which are all proteins. However, whether paeonol acutally has any link to "ERK" is unknown based on the sentence. We can only say that there might be some relationship between "paeonol" and "ERK".</li>
  </ul>


  <h4>Known negative relationship</h4>
  <p><strong>Definition:</strong> used when it was previously thought that there was some relationship between the two concepts, but the sentence conclusively states that the two concepts are not related to one another. This is different from having "no relationship" (see below), because the two concepts are <em>known</em> not to be related. For example, if it was previously thought that "running" and "knee injury" were related (as in, running too much leads to knee injuries), and it is later shown that running itself does not cause knee injuries, but rather running on hard concrete causes knee injuries, then this would be a known negative relationship. The act of running itself it not bad, but rather running on hard concrete is bad.</p>

  Examples of concepts with known negative relationships:
  <ul>
    <li>Consider the sentence: <span class="orig_sentence">We failed to provide evidence of an association between eating <span class="subject_text">prunes</span> and <span class="object_text">athlete's foot</span> based on a large-scale study of athletes.</span></li>
    <li>In the sentence above, scientists wanted to know whether eating too many prunes causes athlete's foot. Despite spending a lot of time studying athletes, they found that there was no link between eating prunes and developing athlete's foot. The scientists specifically wanted to know if there was a link between the two, but found that there is definitely no link.</li>
  </ul>


  <h4>No relationship</h4>
  <p><strong>Definition:</strong> there is no relationship of any kind between the two concepts. They merely happen to be mentioned in the same sentence.</p>

  Examples of concepts that are not related:
  <ul>
    <li>Consider the sentence: <span class="orig_sentence">Alice, who has had <span class="subject_text">asthma</span> since childhood, is an adventurer who loves hang gliding and <span class="object_text">skiing</span>.</span></li>
    <li>There is no relationship at all between "asthma" and "skiing", because the sentence is giving some background information about Alice, and does not try to link the two concepts together. Alice enjoys skiing as a hobby today, but nothing in the sentence suggests that her having asthma might be related to her passion for skiing.</li>
    <li>Consider the sentence:</li>
    <li>other example</li>
  </ul>
