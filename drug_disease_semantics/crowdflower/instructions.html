Title: Determining drug/disease relationships


<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Biomedical literature contains a wealth of information that remains locked in a text based format. In order to be able to effectively search all this knowledge, the information needs to be represented in a structured way. In this task you will be helping scientists organize biomedical knowlege by determining the structured relationships between drugs and diseases.</p>


<h3>The Task</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Read a sentence from a real scientific article. Two parts of the sentence will be highlighted. One will be a drug, and one will be a disease. Pay special attention to the two highlighted terms.</li>
  <li>Determine whether the drug and the disease are related according to the sentence. There are four possible relationship types, detailed below.</li>
  <li>If the sentence says that the drug and the disease are related, then you will be asked to clarify on how they are related. Please choose the most specific answer that faithfully represents the information found in the sentence.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Making your judgement</h3>
<strong>Please base your answers completely upon what is stated in the provided sentence.</strong> For this task, we are only trying to provide an accurate representation of the sentence itself. <strong>We are not looking for "absolute truth"</strong>. Therefore if you know the sentence itself is wrong, then please complete the task according to the sentence and leave us a comment.


<!-- definitions and examples -->

<h4>Drugs and diseases</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Drugs</strong> are substances which, when given to a person, produce a positive or negative effect on the wellbeing of that person. Drugs are commonly used to treat diseases. However, some drugs may produce unwanted side effects.</li>
  <li><strong>Diseases</strong> are abnormal health statuses of living organisms. Diseases can be caused by poisons, viruses, or bacteria.</li>
</ul>


<!-- four relationship type definitions -->

<h3>Definitions of the four kinds of relationships</h3>
For this task, drugs and diseases can be related in four possible ways:
<ol>
  <li><strong>Positive relationship:</strong> the sentence states that there is an association between the drug and the disease.</li>
  <li><strong>Negative relationship:</strong> the sentence states that the drug and the disease are <strong>not</strong> or are known not to be associated.</li>
  <li><strong>Speculative relationship:</strong> the sentence describes a potential relationship between the drug and the disease, but whether the relationship is actually true or not is uncertain.</li>
  <li><strong>Unknown relationship:</strong> the sentence does not talk about whether the drug and the disease are related at all. The two terms merely happen to appear in the same sentence.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Precise relationships between drugs and diseases</h3>

<p>If the sentence states that the drug and disease are somehow related, then you will also be asked to determine the precise relationship between the drug and the disease. Please select the most specific answer which is supported by the sentence.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>May cause:</strong> this choice has the format "[drug] may cause [disease]". This means that the drug could cause the disease as a complication or side effect. How the drug causes the disease does not need to be known.</li>
  <li><strong>Used to treat:</strong> this choice has the format "[drug] is used to treat [disease]". This means that the drug can be used in cells, animals, or people to treat the disease.</li>
  <li><strong>No extra information is given in the sentence:</strong> this choice means that the sentence states that the drug and disease are related, but does not say exactly how.</li>
  <li><strong>There is extra information that is not given as a choice here:</strong> this choice means that there is information about how the drug and disease are related contained in the sentence, but the information fits none of the choices provided.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Practice questions with explanations</h3>
Before you try the Crowdflower quiz, try working through some examples here (provide link to qualtrics quiz). These questions come with explanations, and are provided to help you understand what we are trying to do with this task. Do as many or as few as you wish. When you feel ready to start, then please complete the Crowdflower quiz to begin.
