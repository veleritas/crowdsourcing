Title: Verify drug-disease relationship found in a sentence


<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Biomedical literature contains a wealth of information that remains locked in a text based format. In order to be able to effectively search all this knowledge, the information needs to be represented in a structured way. In this task you will be helping scientists organize biomedical knowlege by determining the structured relationships between drugs and diseases.</p>


<h3>The Task</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Read a sentence. One <span class="object_text">drug</span> and one <span class="subject_text">disease</span> will be highlighted in the sentence. Pay special attention to the two highlighted terms. "Disease" may refer to a broad range of maladies including things like "obesity" and "headaches".</li>
  <li>Determine whether the sentence says that the drug and the disease are associated. There are four types of associations, detailed below.</li>
  <li>If the drug and the disease are associated, then choose an option that specifically describes how they are related.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Definitions of the four types of associations</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Definitely associated:</strong> the sentence explicitly states that there is an association between the drug and the disease.
    <ul>
      <li>Example: "<span class="object_text">Glutorzamine</span> significantly improved clinical symptoms of <span class="subject_text">xylophyremia</span>."</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Speculatively associated:</strong> the sentence indicates the author's opinion that the drug and the disease <strong>might be</strong> associated.
    <ul>
      <li>Example: "Additional clinical studies should clarify whether consumption of <span class="object_text">fluorbenzine</span> increases the risk of <span class="subject_text">adenocarcinoma</span>."</li>
      <li>The sentence suggests that there is a link between <span class="object_text">fluorbenzine</span> and <span class="subject_text">adenocarcinoma</span>, but it is uncertain, because "additional studies" are needed to "clarify" whether the drug increases the risk for the disease.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Not associated:</strong> the sentence explicitly states that the drug and the disease are <strong>not</strong> associated, or that no evidence was found to support the association.
    <ul>
      <li>Example: "Our data demonstrate that there was no correlation between <span class="object_text">plobatinab</span> use and incidence of <span class="subject_text">Torwer's syndrome</span>."</li>
      <li>This sentence says that the authors found no evidence to support the association between <span class="object_text">plobatinab</span> and <span class="subject_text">Torwer's syndrome</span>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>No claim of association:</strong> the sentence makes no claim about whether the drug and the disease are associated. The two terms merely happen to appear in the same sentence.
    <ul>
      <li>Example: "Blood was collected from six women who were taking <span class="object_text">fortaxumab</span>, and five men who had experienced <span class="subject_text">heart attacks</span>."</li>
      <li>There is no claim of association made about <span class="object_text">fortaxumab</span> and <span class="subject_text">heart attacks</span> by the sentence.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>


<h3>Specifying relationships between drugs and diseases</h3>
<p>If the drug and disease are definitely or speculatively associated, then you will also need to determine how the drug and disease are related.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>May cause:</strong> this choice has the format "[<span class="object_text">drug</span>] may cause [<span class="subject_text">disease</span>]". This means that the drug causes the disease as a complication or side effect under certain circumstances. How the drug causes the disease does not need to be known.</li>
  <li><strong>Used in the treatment of:</strong> this choice has the format "[<span class="object_text">drug</span>] is used in the treatment of [<span class="subject_text">disease</span>]". This means that the drug (by itself or with other drugs) is used to treat the disease in cells, animals, or people.</li>

  <li><strong>None of the above:</strong> choose this if the drug is neither causing nor treating the disease, or if it is not known how exactly the drug and disease are related.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Making your judgement</h3>
<strong>Please base your answers only on what is stated in the provided sentence.</strong>
