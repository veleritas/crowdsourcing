Background: SemmedDB creates relationships between concepts from sentences.
There are many correct extracted relationships, and there are also incorrect
relationships.

When the extracted relationship is incorrect, sometimes it is because the
ideas that SemRep linked together are not what the original sentence was
actually referring to.

For example, if SemRep sees "CAT" and takes it to mean a cat (the animal),
when in actuality it is referring to catalase, then this is an error in
concept extraction.

To ensure that the relationships between the concepts are correct, we first
have to ensure that what SemRep is referring to is what the sentence is
actually referring to.

This project falls in the larger project of verifying the gene-disease
relationships produced by SemRep. As such it will be focused on a specific
problem, but I will try to code it in a way that can be easily generalized
and repurposed.

Project goal: Take sentences from PubMed, and determine the gene and disease
SemRep used to make its predication. Present the highlighted text and sentence
to a crowd, and ask whether they believe that the highlighted terms are
actually genes or diseases, and whether the specific disease that SemRep
identified.

Workflow:
	1. Take gene-disease predications from SemmedDB.
	2. Determine the sentence from which this predication arose.
	3. Highlight the portions of the sentence corresponding to the gene and
		the disease.
	4. Gather relevant information that would help the crowd make its decision.
	5. Present to crowd.
	6. See if there is consensus on whether the concept was extracted correctly.
